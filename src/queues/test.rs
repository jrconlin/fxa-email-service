// Although these tests look quite pointless, the implementation of the mock
// means they do achieve a few things that may not be obvious:
//
//  * They ensure that Outgoing methods aren't invoked on Incoming queues and
//    vice versa.
//
//  * They assert that no errors bubble out of the queues with normal inputs.
//
//  * They assert that an error is returned if there is a mismatch between
//    notification_type and the rest of the notification body.
//
//  * They exercise most of the queue-handling code to make sure it runs with
//    no panics.
